# CMPS-3640-Unity-Project

Multiplayer game using Unity and Photon 2. A host can create a room and let up to 3 other players join. Once a match starts, players have to fulfill as many "orders" made at the goal stations as possible. Once the time limit reaches half way, upgraded items will start to be requested.

Press E at the item generators on the lowest floor to spawn the item shown.
Use E to pick-up and hold an item, pressing E again drops the held item and pressing R throws the held item.
Throw an item at an enhance station to upgrade it if needed, and throw it at a goal station to fulfill orders.

Have fun!
